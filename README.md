This is a C++ code for a travel agency whose target is to find the country (from a given file listing the cities and countries) for which maximum number of tickets are purchased. 
This code reads an excel database and other files and returns a file containing the name and the number of tickets purchased for the maximum country. 
It also performs all the general travel agency operations such as buying a ticket and removing the tickets which are past the offer date.

A database has been given along with the list of airports to perform the experimental runs.
